# Bad-Word-Blocker
A fun and simple Python project that filters out bad or offensive words from user input. It replaces them with *** to keep the text clean. Great for learning string handling, conditional logic, and input filtering.  Includes a basic password prompt as a feature â€” just for style, not security.
