# Bad-Word-Blocker
A fun and simple Python project that filters out bad or offensive words from user input. It replaces them with *** to keep the text clean. Great for learning string handling, conditional logic, and input filtering.  Includes a basic password prompt as a feature — just for style, not security.

# 🧼 Bad Word Blocker

This is a small Python project I made to block bad words from a sentence. If you type something with a bad word, it will replace it with `***`.

I also added a simple password feature just for fun before the program starts.

## 📌 What it does:

- Checks for bad words in your sentence
- Replaces them with `***`
- Works even if the word is typed in capital or small letters

## 🛠 Tools used:

- Python
- if-else statements
- String functions like `.replace()` and `.lower()`

## 💡 Why I built this:

I’m learning Python and wanted to try building something useful and fun. This project helped me practice input handling, string filtering, and basic logic. It’s a small step, but it feels great to build things on my own!
